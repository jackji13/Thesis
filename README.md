## 1. Conceptual Research Directions

### Human–Machine Interaction (HMI)

**Projection of Humanity onto Machines:** From ELIZA in the 1960s to today's chatbots, people readily project emotions, trust, and intimacy onto machines—even when they know they're not "real." This booth continues this lineage: a machine that is both a technological artifact and a social mirror.

**Companionship in Isolation:** In a hyperconnected world, loneliness persists. Machines step in as companions: AI therapists, virtual friends, even romantic partners. What does it mean if a payphone booth—once a tool for human-to-human calls—becomes a portal for human-to-AI intimacy?

**Transparency vs Deception:** The booth openly invites people to "call someone," yet the "someone" is a fabrication. This blurs honesty: is interaction valid if it comforts, even when the counterpart is fictional?

### Telephone as Cultural Symbol

**The Payphone as Ruin:** Once central to public life, now obsolete—abandoned booths stand as monuments to outdated communication. By reviving the booth, this project treats it like a ghost infrastructure that speaks again.

**Public vs. Private Communication:** Phone booths were paradoxical: intimate conversations held in public spaces. This project revives this tension—private emotional exchange with a machine, but visible to passersby.

**Nostalgia & Futurity:** The booth is both retro and futuristic. By redesigning it in sleek metal, the project situates it outside time—an ambiguous artifact of both past and future communication.

### AI Persona & Fictional Database

**The Archive of the Never-Was:** A thick yellow pages full of non-existent people is absurd, surreal, and poignant. It echoes Borges' Library of Babel: infinite possibilities, none "real."

**Authenticity vs Fabrication:** Humans seek authenticity, but the stories in this yellow book—"single father," "high school student"—become performances of relatability. These personas are mirrors of our own longing to be seen and known.

**Multiplicity of Selves:** The AI embodies thousands of identities on demand. It dissolves the boundary between "who someone is" and "who they can be scripted to be."

## 2. Thematic Angles for Thesis

### Obsolescence vs. Futurity

This booth resurrects an obsolete technology to ask what futures we imagine through the ruins of the past. It embodies a cyber-ruin aesthetic: both a monument to what we've lost and a speculative portal to what might come.

### Loneliness & Companionship

Humans have always turned to machines for company, from Tamagotchis to Siri. This installation literalizes this: users dial a number seeking connection, and find a voice that is empathetic but fabricated. The booth becomes a stage for exploring the need to be heard, even by no one.

### Trust & Fiction

By presenting fictional contacts as if they were real, the project probes trust in mediated communication. We already "trust" fictional characters on TV or influencers we don't know. This booth compresses that phenomenon into a personal, conversational format: when does fiction feel more real than reality?

### Public vs. Private Conversations

The booth reactivates the paradox of public privacy: people having intimate conversations visible to the street. Now, however, the listener is not another human but an AI—raising questions about surveillance, performance, and vulnerability in public space.

## 3. Framing as a Problem, Question, or Experiment

### Problem

- How do humans navigate intimacy, trust, and companionship in an era where machines increasingly substitute for human presence?
- What happens to obsolete infrastructures of communication (like phone booths) when reimagined as sites of new kinds of interaction?

### Question

- Can an interaction with a fictional AI identity feel as emotionally real—or even more real—than with another human?
- In the future, will machines become our most reliable companions, not despite but because of their artificiality?

### Experiment

- Build a futuristic phone booth installation that connects users to thousands of fictional personas through AI-generated conversations.
- Test how audiences react when they realize they are speaking to no one "real," yet still experience genuine emotions.
- Use the fake yellow pages as both a playful archive and a way to structure the experiment: dialing numbers becomes a ritual, and each number unlocks a new persona.
